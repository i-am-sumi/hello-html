      Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction
      writing, a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same
      thing, with each sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror
      novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love
      letter’s paragraph might focus on the details of your significant other’s
      eyes. No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide
      the clearest picture of your subject.
