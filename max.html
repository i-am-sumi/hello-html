      thoughts by writing down your ideas on a notepad or word document. There's
      no need to write out full sentences just yet, just jot down some keywords
      and phrases. Once you see everything on paper, you may get a clearer idea
      of which points are essential to include in your paragraph, and which
      points are superfluous.
